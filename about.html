        <h1>About Me</h1>
    
        <h3>01 / BACKGROUND</h3>
        <p class="text">
            Hi — people from the Internet. I’m <b>Haotian Wang</b>. I am currently a PhD student in Engineering at the University of Connecticut (UConn), and I expect to graduate in <b> 2026</b>.
            Prior to UConn, I earned my M.Sc. in Engineering and B.S. in Engineering from Wuhan University, where I built a b foundation in data-driven modeling and large-scale spatiotemporal analysis.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Across my academic and internship experiences, I have worked on translating complex real-world data into practical machine learning solutions, collaborating closely with interdisciplinary research and industry teams.
        </p>
    
        <h3>02 / RESEARCH</h3>
        <p class="text">
            My research focuses on applying machine learning and deep learning to solve real-world challenges in hydrology and climate, particularly where robust modeling and decision support are critical.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            My recent work centers on flood inundation mapping and forecasting, as well as modeling crop water stress and improving irrigation prediction under human impacts by integrating spatiotemporal signals from ground measurements and remote sensing observations.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            More recently, my interests are evolving toward social impact and Generative AI, exploring how generative models and foundation models can enhance robustness, uncertainty awareness, and actionable decision-making in high-stakes environmental and societal applications.
        </p>
    
        <h3>03 / HOBBIES</h3>
        <p class="text">
            Outside of research, I’m a proud cat lover 🐾. I enjoy skiing, and I’m also fascinated by color theory—especially how color combinations influence aesthetics, clarity, and storytelling in data visualization and design.
